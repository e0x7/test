# Wordlists
General repository where I put my/others wordlists.

## Why this repo?
One time I found my self on a linux distro without any wordlist and it has been quite a annoying crawl the web to grab at least one.
So, I decided to create this repo to have different wordlists on the fly if needed (*and if Internet permits it*)

## What is there?
Literally every wordlist that I create, use and find in other distro (ParrotOS/Kali Linux) and on the web .
